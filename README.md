# Project_Flashcards_Qualified_1
Online deck of flashcards for studying

This is a project was produced under the guidiance of my courses with Thinkful. The application allows the user to customize decks of flashcards as well as the individual cards.  The decks can be accessed, fliped and modified via buttons.  This was created in a group effort with other students.  Tools and languages used include JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS.
